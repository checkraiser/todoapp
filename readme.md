#[Todo App](http://juanolvera.com/todoapp/ "Todo App")

A Tiny jQuery Todo App

![TodoScreenShoot](https://github.com/thinkxl/todoapp/blob/master/img/todo.png?raw=true)

I did it just for practice, I'm not a jQuery hacker even if you see the code is very primitive, maybe you can do it 1000 times better, but I wanted to do this only for educative proposits with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

I want to learn [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/)... so when I was googling I found [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) that is basically a repository of the same TodoApp made up by each JavaScript Framework or Library... or almost most of them.

## TODO: ##
- Add a double click edit function on each task.
- Add a 's' on "# task left" when are more than 1 task. (1 task left, 2 tasks left)
