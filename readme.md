made with jQuery

I did it just for practice, I'm not a jQuery hacker even if you see the code is very primitive, maybe you can do it 1000 times better, but I wanted to do this only for educative proposits with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

I want to learn [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/)... so when I was googling I found [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) that is basically a repository of the same TodoApp made up by each JavaScript Framework or Library... or almost most of them.

## TODO: ##
- Add localStorage stuff.
- focusOut function that 'contentEditable','false' current task
